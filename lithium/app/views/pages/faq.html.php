<h1>GENERAL</h1> 

<h3>What is Bravo Your City?</h3>
BRAVO YOUR CITY is a world travel and social enrichment webzine with written and visual content that is entirely user-generated but is edited like a professional magazine. BYC publishes authentic, unique stories for world travelers written by locally-based or well-traveled contributors of the destination city, making it uniquely different than what is currently out there. Not only will popular destinations be featured but under-the-radar locations will be added as the BYC community grows. The diverse content is created by a large group of world contributors, which is then curated by professional editors. BYC's signature submission parameters are: one location, accompanied by 1-5 photos and 1-500 words of text. These simple guidelines make it easy to submit multiple stories.

<h3>What is your purpose?</h3>
The aim of BYC is to serve local communities while providing a resource for global travelers. It's a platform for global travelers who are looking for a more authentic traveling experience, but it is also for locals who want to learn and share about what's happening in their community while giving back to it at the same time through BYC 50% profit sharing. 

<h3>Why is it called Bravo Your City?</h3>
It's a little wink to <a href="http://bravoyourlife.com">Bravo Your Life!</a> -- the travel essay/memoir book the founder MiSoon Burzlaff wrote before she started BYC.

<h1>CONTRIBUTORS</h1> 


<h3>How can I become a contributing writer or photographer?</h3>
Just click <a href="/story/edit">submit</a> 

<h3>May I submit just photos or just writing?</h3> 
Yes. We think the submission guidelines keep it simple and sweet, so try your hand at a little photography or writing a few sentences or a paragraph even if you think writing is not your forte. You can also pair up with a friend and submit photos and writing as a duo. Just give credit to the photographer in the captions and have the writer submit the story. In the Beta release, there will be a section for writers to submit stories in search of photographers and vice versa. We think this might be a fun way to collaborate and meet someone new in your community. 

<h3>Do I need to live in the city or area of the city I submit about?</h3> 
No. We do encourage you to submit the most about what you know. It makes sense that you'd contribute stories about where you live, but if you travel often, want to cover stories in your hometown, or places you used to live, we'd love to receive those submissions. We encourage all submissions to reflect you. Tell us about the dumpling cafe you always visit when you go to Shanghai. Feature an interesting or notable person in your hometown. 

<h3>What kind of cities do you want content for?</h3> 
We want places you think need to be on the BYC map. Of course, we want all the glossy cosmopolitan cities, but we also want BYC to be a resource for what's going on in small towns (like in Napa Valley or upstate New York) or mid-sized cities you might not think people are interested in. Travelers do find themselves in Cleveland, Little Rock, Minneapolis, Sacramento, Narita, Incheon, Lyon, Cornwall, etc and they will want to use BYC to learn about these off-the-radar locations.

<h3>Do you pay contributors for content that gets published to BYC?</h3> 
Yes!
<!--
<h3>How much do you pay contibutors?</h3>
Contributors will receive 5% of the profit from their stories that are sold.

<h3>When do you pay contributors?</h3>
We will issue checks or use Paypal to pay you on the 1st of every month, the month after your stories have been sold. 

<h3>Do I have to pay taxes on these stories?</h3> 
All contributors must fill out a W9 (American) or W8 (Foreign) tax form electronically with an e-signature on Bravo Your City! The law states that those who fill out W8 forms must have 30% of the income withheld and paid to the IRS unless you live in a country with a tax treaty like the UK or South Korea, so double taxation isn't applied. 

<h3>Where and how are these stories sold?</h3> 
This answer must be saved for the Beta release. It will all make perfect sense then.
