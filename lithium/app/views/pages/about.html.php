		<h1>ABOUT</h1>
		
		<p>BRAVO YOUR CITY! publishes authentic and unique stories for the world -- by the world -- about the world. BYC is a user-generated, global travel and social enrichment webzine with written and visual content that is edited and published as a professional magazine. The diverse content is created by everyday global people, which is then curated by professional editors. BYC's sweet and simple submission parameters of: 1 location, 1-5 photos and 1-500 words make it easy to submit multiple stories.
		
		<p>BYC integrates a new paradigm into magazine culture vis-Ã -vis production, publication and distribution. We are a magazine that is produced by everyday locals around the world who are rooted in their communities or who have a love for traveling. BYC then publishes their work professionally and rewards them.
		
		<p>Regarding international travel, we are breaking away from the outdated travel writing model, whereby the writer is paid to be a tourist to research and write about a destination and then tell about it to the reader. Something real gets lost in that old way. The BYC way views anyone as a potential writer/contributor, allowing an array of different perspectives about local and global interests.
		
		<p>Bravo Your City and Bravo Your Life!
