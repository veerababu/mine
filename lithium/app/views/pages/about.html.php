		<h1>ABOUT</h1>
		
		<p>BRAVO YOUR CITY! is a user-generated, global travel and social enrichment webzine with written and visual content that is edited and published like a professional magazine. BYC publishes authentic and unique stories for the world -- by the world -- about the world. The diverse content is created by everyday global people, which is then curated by professional editors. BYC's sweet and simple submission parameters of: 1 location, 1-5 photos and 1-500 words make it easy to submit multiple stories.
		
		<p>BYC integrates a new paradigm into magazine culture vis-Ã -vis production, publication and distribution. We are a magazine that is produced by everyday locals around the world who are rooted in their communities. BYC then publishes their work professionally and pays them a percentage of their stories' sales. When we have enough content, any BYC user can become a paid guest editor and curate a collection of stories that will be published as electronic magazines, otherwise known as BYC Microguides. Users who don't write or photograph have the opportunity to read it for fun and guest curate stories into different guides about almost anything in the world, anywhere in the world -- from subjects like traditional travel advice, fashion, art, architecture, film and music reviews, nature, photography, musings, recipes -- the options are endless. 
		
		<p>Regarding international travel, we are breaking away from the outdated travel writing model, whereby the writer is paid to be a tourist to research and write about a destination and then tell about it to the reader. Something real gets lost in that old way. The BYC way views anyone as a potential writer/contributor, allowing an array of different perspectives about local and global interests.
