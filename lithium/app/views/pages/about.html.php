<h1>ABOUT</h1>

<p>Bravo Your City is a world travel and social enrichment webzine with written and visual content that is entirely user generated, but it is curated like a professional magazine. BYC's specialty is publishing authentic, unique stories for residents to world travelers but by local contributors, making it uniquely different yet conveniently similar to other global travel websites because we offer all the same locations and destinations as we grow. The diverse content is created by a large group of local contributors, which is then curated by professional BYC editors. BYC has signature story parameters that we think you will find refreshing and fun to view. Each submission must have 1 location, 1-5 photos, and 1-500 words: these guidelines make it easy to submit multiple stories.

<p>BYC integrates a new paradigm into magazine culture and the global travel market. BYC is breaking from the outdated travel writing model, where the writer and photographer are paid to research and travel to a destination and then tell us about it: Something real gets lost in that old way. Original, unique and local content is amassed from contributing user submissions (1 story in 1 location), curated professionally (by BYC editors), and then guest user curated again (suggested microguides) by local BYC users combing the content to make and submit unique microguides for the perfect cultural, social or travel guide combination. This means users don't have to be published contributors to get paid. Users who don't write or photograph -- who just love the site -- have the opportunity to read it for fun and then work freelance as a guest editor for BYC!

<p>BYC is a place for locals to learn about what's happening in their community and learn about other locals, along with being a resource for when those locals turn into global travelers who also want to learn and connect with locals where they travel to. Eventually BYC Microguides will become a custom magazine aggregator for users anywhere in the world to read about almost anything in the world.
