		<h1>ABOUT</h1>
		
		<p>BRAVO YOUR CITY is a world travel and social enrichment webzine with written and visual content that is entirely user-generated but is edited like a professional magazine. BYC publishes authentic, unique stories for world travelers written by locally-based or well-traveled contributors of the destination city, making it uniquely different than what is currently out there. Not only will popular destinations be featured but under-the-radar locations will be added as the BYC community grows. The diverse content is created by a large group of world contributors, which is then curated by professional editors. BYC's signature submission parameters are: one location, accompanied by 1-5 photos and 1-500 words of text. These simple guidelines make it easy to submit multiple stories.
		
		<p>BYC integrates a new paradigm into magazine culture and the global travel market by breaking away from the outdated travel writing model, whereby the writer is paid to be a tourist to research and write about a destination and then tell about it to the reader.  Something real gets lost in that old way. The BYC way views anyone as a potential writer/contributor, allowing an array of different perspectives about local and global interests.
		
		<p>The aim of BYC is to serve local communities while providing a resource for global travelers. It's a platform for global travelers who are looking for a more authentic traveling experience, but it is also for locals who want to learn and share about what's happening in their community while giving back to it at the same time through BYC 50% profit sharing.
