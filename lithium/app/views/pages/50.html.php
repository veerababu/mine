<h1>Giving back half</h1>
We donate 50% of our profits to nonprofit organizations locally and globally. As stories are submitted to BYC, the locations are tagged by the contributors so we can track which geographical area the donation will serve. As BYC grows, we will feature each organization by location, so you can follow where the 50% profit sharing goes. For example, if a contributor's story is about a restaurant is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, 50% of the profit each time that story is sold will go right back to a Lower East Side charity. Similarly, if a story is about a park in the Latin Quarter in Paris, the 50% will go to a non-profit organization right in the Latin Quarter. As long as BYC's content is geographically diverse, the local and global implications of this 50% profit sharing is far-reaching.

BYC recognizes that, as an internet company, we produce and sell an intellectual product that doesn't necessarily create that many jobs, in the way a traditional company that manufactures tangible items does.  The 50% donation is our way of offsetting this imbalance. By integrating social philanthropy into the business core from the beginning, we can do our part to create, sustain or support organizations that work for greater social causes in our world. Our 50% donation is given after operating costs are covered.
